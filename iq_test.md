## Questions
1. A bat and a ball cost $1,10 in total. The bat costs $1,00 more than the ball. How much does the ball cost? 
2. If it takes 5 machines 5 minutes to make 5 widgets, how long would it take 100 machines to make 100 widgets? 
3. In a lake, there is a patch of lily pads. Every day, the patch doubles in size. If it takes 48 days for the patch to cover the entire lake, how long would it take for the patch to cover half of the lake?

We need to do some basic math for this. Basically we have a system of two unknowns. First, the total cost of the bat `X` and ball `Y` together is `X + Y = 1.10` (A) and we can express the cost of the ball as `Y = X - 1.00` (B).

So we have:
```
A: X + Y = 1.10     -- the total cost
B: Y = X - 1.00     -- the price of the ball
```

Now a neat thing we can do is we can substitute (replace) the `Y` in equation A with equation B. We can do this because B is actually a definition of the `Y` value:
```
X + Y = 1.10 = X + (X - 1.00)
```

Now we have `X + (X - 1.00)` which is the same as `X + X - 1.00`. We also know that `X + X = 2X` so we can rewrite this as:
```
X + Y = 1.10 = 2X - 1.00
```

This means, the total cost of the ball and the bat is equal to $1.10 and this is also equal to the cost of the bat plus the cost of the bat minus $1.00 which equals two times the cost of the bat minus $1.00.

So now we know that two times the cost of the bat (`X`) minus $1.00 is equal to the total cost of the ball and bat together:
```
2X - 1.00 = 1.10
```

This means that two times the cost of the ball is equal to the total cost and an additional $1.00:
```
2X = 1.10 + 1.00 = 2.10
```

And now we know that $2.10 equals the cost of two bats to we just have to divide that and get our answer:
```
2X = 2.10
X = 2.10/2 = 1.05
```

So the cost of a bat is $1.05 and now we also know a ball costs $0.05. Pretty cheap stuff!

If it takes five machines, five minutes to make five widgets this means that it takes one machine five minutes to make one widget.

Let's call the the number of widgets per minute `X` and the number of machines we have available `Y` and formalize this. 
```
X = Y/5
``` 

The above says if we run `Y` number of machines for 1 minute we have `Y/5` widgets.



This is just scaling, the amount of things you will produce will increase but the time it takes will not so: 5 minutes.

1X = 1

The patch doubles in size every day. So it had to cover only half a lake the day before it covers the complete lake: 47 days.
