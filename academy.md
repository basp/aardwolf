# Academy
Claire says, "Aardwolf contains an extensive help system. Most commands,
 skills, spells and features in the game have detailed helpfiles containing
 everything you need to know."

Claire says, "To view help on a subject, enter 'Help [topic]'. For
 example, type 'help kill' to view the helpfile for the kill command."

Claire says, "You can view a summary of helpfiles using the 'index'
 command. The 'index' command displays all helpfiles beginning with the
 letters you enter."

Claire says, "To see a list of all help files in a category, use the
 'contents' command. Typing 'contents' by itself will show a list of the
 help categories."

Claire says, "You may also search helpfiles using 'help search [text]'.
 Make a note of this one as you will need it for your test at the end."

Vorth says, "Our final lesson covers affects on your character. Many
 skills and spells will temporarily affect you in some way. Magical items
 may increase your skills while worn, and some abilities have a recovery
 time before they can be used again."

Vorth says, "All affects on your character can be seen with the 'affects'
 command."

|                                                                 |

Commander Dahr says, "The 'areas' command shows all the areas available in
 Andolor. To restrict the areas listed to a specific level, use 'areas
 [start level] [end level]'. There are several other ways to filter the
 areas listed - more on this can be seen in 'help areas'."

Commander Dahr says, "Another extremely useful command for finding good
 hunting areas is the 'mobdeaths' command. Mobdeaths shows the most killed
 monsters in a level range. Seeing where others in your level range are
 hunting is a great way to find new areas to explore."

Commander Dahr says, "You can also filter mobdeaths by alignment to list
 only monsters considered evil or good. For example, to list the most
 killed evil monsters between level 1 and 5, use 'mobdeaths 1 5 evil'."

Commander Dahr says, "For a reminder of these two commands, most
 experience gained, and useful tips on how to be a more efficient leveler,
 read NewGuide-Leveling of your Aardwolf Newbie Guide. Browsing the other
 pages of your guide is highly recommended, as it contains a lot of useful
 information."

Commander Dahr says, "Take some time to read the helpfiles on 'areas' and
 'mobdeaths' then experiment with the commands. Our next lesson shows you
 how to find your way to an area. Type 'next' when you are ready to move
 on."

 Commander Dahr says, "The 'scan' command shows all visible monsters in the
 surrounding locations. You can also scan in a single direction by typing,
 for example, 'scan north'."

Commander Dahr says, "The 'where' command is used to show all other
 visible players in the area, or to find a specific monster. Type 'where'
 on its own to see all players in the area. To find a kobold in the area,
 you would type 'where kobold'. The helpfile for 'where' contains more
 information."

Commander Dahr says, "Lastly, the 'study' command shows the health of all
 characters in the same room as you. Type 'study' now to see an example,
 then I will cover the basics of what to do while actually in combat."

 Commander Dahr says, "During combat you are shown your target's status
 after each round of combat. Your prompt also changes to your 'battle
 prompt'. Your battle prompt contains the percentage of health your target
 has remaining."

Commander Dahr says, "Prompts are highly configurable and are covered
 later in your academy training. If you want to learn more about them now,
 read 'help prompt'."

Commander Dahr says, "When your target's hit points fall below 0, it is
 dead. Most monsters leave behind a corpse that may contain some gold or
 equipment when they die."

Commander Dahr says, "By default, you automatically loot gold and
 equipment from corpses then sacrifice the corpse to receive a little extra
 gold."

Commander Dahr says, "You can turn these options on and off using the
 commands 'autogold', 'autoloot' and 'autosac'. There are many other
 configuration options available that are beyond the scope of this lesson.
 You can view them by typing 'config all' - the commands listed each have
 their own helpfile."

Commander Dahr says, "If you gain a level, remember to return to the
 academy or your guild to train your stats and practice your new skills
 before continuing."

Nurse Orcron says, "Sooner or later while exploring Aardwolf, you will
 die. When you die, you will return to the Aylorian Hospital. If you die to
 a monster you will lose some experience and may possibly lose a stat."

Nurse Orcron says, "After dying, your main concern is healing yourself and
 finding your corpse. Any equipment you were carrying will be in your
 corpse in the room where you died. Typing 'ownedwhere' will show the
 location of your corpse."

Nurse Orcron says, "In some cases, you will be able to simply heal and
 walk to your corpse to retrieve it. To get all the items from your corpse,
 type 'get all corpse'."

Nurse Orcron says, "If the corpse is in a dark room or outside at night,
 picking up a light from Grizrol's grocery store before leaving the city is
 recommended. From anywhere in Aylor, typing 'find groceries' gives
 directions."

Nurse Orcron says, "If you die in a room full of aggressive monsters that
 are too big for you, or are having trouble finding your corpse, see if you
 can find a [Helper] to assist you. If no helpers are available, other
 players may be able to help."

Nurse Orcron says, "Your corpse lasts for 3 hours of real time. If you
 quit the game, your corpse is saved with you and the timer stops until the
 next time you log in."

Nurse Orcron says, "As a last resort, if you can't get to your corpse and
 nobody is available to help, you can 'quit' and try again later, knowing
 that your corpse is safe in the meantime."

Nurse Orcron says, "That's all I have to teach you Laly. Please read 'help
 death' and 'help cr' for more information on death and corpse
 retrieval."

Nurse Orcron says, "There is no quiz for my lesson. If you are ready to
 move on type 'next'. Otherwise, you can type 'restart' to see my lessons
 again."

Filt says, "There are many different equipment types such as weapons,
 armor, shields, wands, scrolls and food. Different items are used in
 different ways. My lessons teach you the basics with further reading
 recommended to learn the details of equipment in Aardwolf."

Filt says, "To see the equipment you are carrying, use the command
 'inventory'. To see the equipment you are actively using, type
 'equipment'. These two commands can be abbreviated as 'inv' and 'eq'."

Filt says, "The 'get', 'drop' and 'put' commands allow you to manipulate
 your inventory. The 'give' command is used to give items to other
 characters in the game. To get a sword on the ground, type 'get sword'. To
 drop it, type 'drop sword'."

Filt says, "If you are carrying more than one sword and want to drop the
 second one, type 'drop 2.sword'. Using 'drop second.sword' or 'drop
 2nd.sword' also works. To drop all the swords in your inventory, use 'drop
 all.sword'."

Filt says, "The '2.item' and 'all.item' syntax also works with get, put,
 sell and several other commands. For more details and options, read 'help
 get'."

Filt says, "Let's take a look at your inventory and equipment. Type 'inv'
 then 'eq' to move on. In the next lesson we will discuss containers."
 
Filt says, "You can only wear items your own level or lower and some items
 may have other restrictions such as evil only or good only. Other items
 will add bonuses to resistances, skills or stats while worn. The
 'identify' command shows you the basic stats of an item."

Filt says, "To see the full stats on a piece of equipment, visit Hester's
 item appraisals in Aylor to identify the item for a fee. To find Hester's,
 type 'find identify' from anywhere within the city of Aylor."

Filt says, "Appraising an item in a store or auctioning it also shows the
 full stats; these are covered in the economics lesson. Finally, depending
 on your guild, you may be able to 'identify' or 'lore' items for yourself
 as you increase in level. There is also an identify wish."

Filt says, "There are many item types and identify will show a slightly
 different format depending on the type of item. We cannot cover all item
 types in this lesson, but their use is fairly intuitive."
 
Filt says, "You wear armor, you wield a weapon, you put things into a
 container, you sail in a boat, you eat a pill and quaff a potion. As
 always, the helpfiles contain further information."

 Filt says, "Another very important thing to know is that while you can
 save any level of equipment, keys and some other special items do not save
 at all when you quit the game."

Filt says, "Finally, it is important for you to know what the object flags
 in identify mean. To see a list of object flags, type 'help object flags'.
 Please pay attention to this one closely, you will need it for the
 test."

Aaeron says, "The 'say' command sends a message to your current location
 only. Says are so widely used that the single quote is an abbreviation for
 the say command; typing 'hi is the same as 'say hi'."

Aaeron says, "There are some fun options that can modify the verb used
 from "says" to "asks" or "exclaims" for example. These are listed in 'help
 say'"

Aaeron says, "Emotes are imaginary actions in a room. Whatever you enter
 after the emote command is prefixed with your character name. For example,
 if you enter 'emote hopes to graduate soon.' the rest of the room will see
 'Laly hopes to graduate soon.'."

Aaeron says, "There are many predefined emotes that are known as
 'socials'. The 'nod' command is a social, as are 'smile' and 'bow'"

Aaeron says, "There are over 2,000 socials in total. The 'socials' command
 shows a list of all available socials: To search the socials for a
 specific phrase, use 'socials [search text]'. To see all output options
 for a specific social, use 'shelp [social name]'."

Aaeron says, "Here's a fun command to try. The 'random' command picks a
 random social and uses it. To use a random social on a channel, enter
 '[channel] *random'. Please try this now, type 'random' to move on."

Aaeron says, "To communicate with a single online player privately, use
 the 'tell' command. You can also leave someone a personal note they will
 receive when they next login. Sending notes is covered in the next lesson,
 this lesson covers tells."

Aaeron says, "To send a tell to a player, type 'tell [player] [message]'.
 If the player is flagged as away or is in combat, you may see a message
 that your tell will be saved until they can read it. To send a tell to the
 last person who sent you a tell, use 'reply [message]'."

Aaeron says, "If someone sends you a tell while you are away, or you have
 'catchtells' on, type 'replay' to see it. Your tell history can be seen by
 typing 'tell -h'."

Aaeron says, "Sometimes, for whatever reason, you don't want to receive
 tells from a specific person. The 'ignore' command can be used for this;
 see 'help ignore' for more details."

Aaeron says, "There are many ways to configure your tell options. We
 cannot cover them all here, but reading 'help page', 'help catchtells',
 'help afk' and 'help deaf' will get you started."

Aaeron says, "Some channels are sent only to a specific group of players.
 One of the most useful of these is your 'friend list'."

Aaeron says, "As you meet people during your adventures, you may want to
 add them to your friend list. To do so, type 'friend [player name]'. To
 see a list of all the people on your friend list, type 'friend'."

Aaeron says, "The 'ftalk' channel can be used to talk to all your online
 friends at the same time. See 'help friend' for more details on how the
 friend system works."

Aaeron says, "Some channels are for information only and notify you about
 events in the game. The most important of these is 'info' which allows you
 turn on and off groups of event messages."

Aaeron says, "Type 'info' now to see an example. To turn info on/off, use
 'info [channel name]' or 'noinfo' to turn them all off at once."

Aaeron says, "Finally, there are times when you want to stop all channel
 output without having to turn each channel on and off individually. The
 'quiet' command does this; it is particularly useful while reading the
 forums. Forums are covered in our next lesson."

Aaeron exclaims, "This completes the overview of channels. I strongly
 recommend you type 'channels' and browse the list. Turn those on that you
 think might be interesting and welcome to the Aardwolf Community!"

Aaeron says, "Channels and tells are great for communicating with people
 online. Forums are more permanent. Most forums are public discussion
 boards, but there is also a personal forum where you can send a private
 message to an offline player."

Aaeron says, "Everything you need to know about using the forums is
 contained in 'help forums' and 'help note'. I am only going to cover the
 basics."

Aaeron says, "To see a list of forums you have access to, type
 'subscribe'. Please try that now before we move on."


Aaeron says, "To read a forum, type 'forum [forum name]' to switch to that
 forum, then 'note read' to read each note in order. Using 'note list 50'
 will show the headers of only the last 50 notes."

Aaeron says, "If you find a forum you are not interested in, you can stop
 seeing announcements for it by typing 'subscribe [forum name]'. Repeat the
 same command to turn it back on. Type 'subscribe' on its own to see all
 forums and their status."

Aaeron says, "To learn how to write notes of your own, or search the list
 of posted notes by author, by recipient or by title; please study 'help
 note'."

Aaeron says, "There are two forums that are important for you to read each
 time you login. The 'announce' and 'mudinfo' forums contain important
 updates from the game administration and often list newly added commands
 and features."

Aaeron says, "Finally, as a new player, the amount of notes already on the
 forums can be overwhelming. You can skip over all notes on a single forum
 using 'note catchup'. To skip all notes on all forums except announce and
 mudinfo, use 'note catchup all'."

Aaeron says, "I have sent a personal note to you telling you how to move
 on to the next lesson. Please read that note then we can continue. As a
 reminder, 'forum personal' will switch you to that forum and 'note read'
 reads each note in order."

+------------------------------------------------------------------+

Klau says, "To turn the display of the map on and off, use the 'automap'
 command. To keep the map on while exploring but turned off during runs,
 use the 'maprun' command."

Klau says, "The 'shortmap' and 'maptags' commands also modify how your map
 displays. Read the helpfiles on each of these commands for more
 information."

Klau says, "Exploring Andolor can become an obsession and many adventurers
 make this their primary focus. There are some tools in the game to help
 you track which rooms you have explored."

Klau says, "Typing 'explored' shows the number of explorable rooms in your
 current area and how many of those rooms you have visited. It also shows
 the total number of explorable rooms in the entire game and how many you
 have visited."

Klau says, "To see areas in which you have explored at least one room,
 type 'areas explored'. To see areas you have not yet fully explored, type
 'areas unexplored'."

Klau says, "To see the top explorers on Aardwolf, type 'rank 15'. Feel
 free to browse the other rankings while you're at it, type 'rank' to see a
 list of them. To see a summary of your own standing on each ranking, type
 'myrank'. However, at this stage, you are unlikely to be listed on any of
 them."

Klau says, "Exploring 100% of Aardwolf is difficult, there are many quests
 in areas that need to be completed in order to do this. Within the
 Aardwolf community, these are known as 'area quests' or 'AQs'."

Klau says, "Some area quests can be quite complex, but the clues are
 there. Be careful to read descriptions carefully and 'listen' to
 characters in areas for clues if you plan to complete area quests."

Klau says, "Each time you enter a room, the full room description is
 shown. The 'brief' command can be used to turn off automatic display of
 room descriptions (they are still shown when you look), or to only show
 descriptions the first time you enter a new room. Type 'brief' now to
 continue."


Klau says, "Your primary means of getting from place to place in Andolor
 is by walking or using the 'run' command. However, there are a few
 shortcuts I will briefly cover."

Klau says, "Portals are commonly used throughout the game and allow you to
 quickly get from one place to another. Portals in the room are entered by
 using 'enter [portal name]'. To use portals in your inventory, hold the
 portal and type 'enter'."

Klau says, "Some spells such as 'nexus' and 'chaos portal' create portals.
 Other abilities such as 'wayfind' allow you to see the destination of a
 portal before entering."

Klau says, "Some monsters in the game drop portals when killed. Most
 portals are acquired as a reward for completing area quests. Having
 completed the quest, the portal allows you to quickly return to the
 area."

Klau says, "Custom portals can also be purchased with trivia points, see
 'help trivia portals' for more on this."

Klau says, "Some rooms prevent the use of the 'recall' command but still
 allow portal entry. It is recommended to keep at least one portal in your
 inventory at all times for this reason. You can also enter portals while
 webbed, see 'help web' for details on this spell."

Klau says, "In addition to portals, many spells and skills allow you to
 move around Andolor more freely. Check out 'spells movement' and 'skills
 movement' to see examples. Each ability listed has its own helpfile."

Klau says, "I have mentioned a lot of help files in this lesson. Please
 take some time to review them. Type next when you are ready to move on."


Klau says, "My final two lessons cover a little more on how to explore
 within each area."

Klau says, "While exploring an area you will often encounter doors. Most
 doors can be opened using 'open [direction]'. If a closed door is to the
 north, typing 'open north' will open it."

Klau says, "Other doors may be locked and require you to find a key or use
 magic and skills to open them. You will often need to kill or bribe a
 character to obtain a key, or buy it from a store. Once you have a key,
 'unlock [direction]' opens it."

Klau says, "If a key is on the ground before a locked door, 'unlock'
 automatically uses that key. Many adventurers will leave keys for others
 to use, please leave them there."

Klau says, "You may also encounter containers such as chests and desks
 that can only be unlocked with a key. The commands are the same for
 these."

Klau says, "Thieves have a skill called 'pick lock' that attempts to open
 a lock without the key. Warriors can go for a more direct approach and use
 'bashdoor'. Mages have a spell called 'knock' that can sometimes open a
 locked door."

Klau says, "The 'passdoor' affect allows characters to walk through some
 closed doors. The shadow race has pass door permanently. Pass door is also
 available in a number of potions and can be purchased with quest points as
 a 'wish'."

Klau says, "Regardless of all these, some doors are protected and can only
 be unlocked with the correct key or item."



Klau says, "Typing 'exits' in any room shows the list of visible exits.
 You also see a summary of exits in the room each time you look. To turn
 this on and off, use the 'autoexit' command. If the exits list shows ( )
 around an exit name, that means the exit is closed."

Klau says, "Some rooms show an exit as '[other]'. This means the exit is a
 custom exit and not a standard direction. In this case, type 'exits' to
 see the command needed to use that exit."

Klau says, "Doors and custom exits are not always visible. Sometimes you
 must explore and solve puzzles to determine the exits to use. For example,
 examining a shelf may show that there is a hidden passage and the command
 to enter is 'move shelf'. Other times, you just need to look around."

Glimmer says, "Browsing the list of clans, you will notice that most allow
 their members to 'PK'. PK is an abbreviation for 'player killing'. Player
 killing occurs when players fight each other rather than game controlled
 characters."

Glimmer says, "For some, player killing can be the most thrilling part of
 the game, testing your skills against others, laying traps and ambushing
 enemy clans and grouping to raid another clan's hall. Read 'help pk' for
 more information on player killing."

Glimmer says, "There is a complex and detailed alliance system. Clans can
 be allied with each other, hostile, friendly, neutral or at war. Alliance
 status with another clan determines how you may interact with other
 members of that clan."

Glimmer says, "Read 'help allies' to see more details on the alliance
 system. To see a clan's alliance status with other clans, use 'clanall
 [clan name]'."

Glimmer says, "While some players find PK exciting, others do not enjoy it
 at all. Some clans are considered 'nopk' clans and do not take part in the
 PK system. Of course, membership of a clan does not have to be for life,
 you can try both types of clan. Read 'help outcast' for more on this."

Glimmer says, "In summary, clans are a very complex part of the game. Many
 clans develop friendships that survive beyond their Aardwolf adventures.
 Joining a clan is something you should consider very seriously before
 jumping in."

Glimmer says, "'Boot Camp' is a clan focused on new players and helping
 others learn the game. It is often recommended as a starting clan."

Market: Windprayer is selling the Dark Lady's blessing (Level 131, Num 80852). Auction is for Gold.
Market: This item has a buyout price of 3,900,000.

Glimmer says, "Whichever clan you join, before doing so you should talk to
 the members, talk to others, get a feel for what each clan represents and
 which is likely to suit you the best."

Wolfie says, "Player killing or 'pk' is covered in more detail in the
 social studies training. At higher levels, many players make a career out
 of player killing as it provides endless variety and challenge."

Wolfie says, "No encounter with another player is ever quite the same.
 Each player trains their stats and abilities differently and the strategy
 to fight another player can vary greatly based on their class and subclass
 vs your own."

Wolfie says, "Player killing is not for everyone, but there are several
 ways to test your skills against others without actually "killing"
 them."

Wolfie says, "The war zone is an area where groups of players can fight
 each other without any penalties for losing. There are guild wars, race
 wars, clan wars and free-for-all genocide wars. See 'help warfare' for
 more information."

Wolfie says, "You do not automatically see warfare messages. Type 'nowar'
 to turn them on if you have not already done so."

Wolfie says, "You can also challenge other players one on one in a penalty
 free environment using the duel system. See 'help duel' for more
 information on this."

Wolfie says, "Finally, there are some rooms in Andolor that are considered
 'combat maze' rooms. Players can fight each other in these rooms without
 any restrictions, and there are no penalties for dying."

Wolfie says, "This covers most of the options for testing your skills
 against others. Type 'next' when you are ready to move on and learn about
 the rankings."

Lao says, "Your final lesson is about commands to customize how Aardwolf
 appears to you, and how you appear to Aardwolf."

Lao says, "There are many configuration options that change game output,
 display of damage, color settings and channels. Other configuration
 options allow you to change options that other players have for
 interacting with you, and add additional information about your
 character."

Lao says, "The most important of these are the 'config' and 'spamreduce'
 commands. Typing 'config all' shows a list of config options that can be
 turned on and off by typing the listed command. Typing 'spamreduce' shows
 a list of options that can be turned on to reduce game output."

Lao says, "The purpose of these config options varies greatly. I recommend
 you browse the list and the short description, then read the individual
 helpfiles on any of the commands you are more interested in. Commands from
 'config all' and 'spamreduce' may also be in my test at the end of your
 lessons."

Lao says, "In addition to config options, there are options to change how
 damage is displayed, what notifications you receive at login, custom color
 settings and what updates you receive from the game. I will now cover each
 of these in turn."

Lao says, "The 'damage' command alters how you see damage in combat. The
 default setting is that each hit is shown as a single line. Other 'damage'
 settings allow you to display a single line containing the average per
 round of combat or the total damage per round of combat. Type 'damage' by
 itself to see the options."

Lao says, "The 'notify' command allows you to change the notifications
 received at login. See 'help notify' for help on changing login
 notifications."

Lao says, "The 'info' command allows you to change which game events you
 see, including player deaths, new users, clan recruitment and new notes.
 Type 'info' by itself for a list of options."

Lao says, "The 'colorset' command is used to change the default colors for
 many different types of game output such as room names and other players.
 Colorset is also used to customize the default output color for channels.
 Type 'colorset' by itself to see options and 'colorset status' to see your
 current settings."

Lao says, "The 'prompt' and 'bprompt' commands were covered briefly in
 battle training but are worth repeating. Your prompt can be customized to
 display many extra pieces of information you may find useful. See 'help
 prompt' for more details. Prompt variables will also be in your test."

Lao says, "This completes the most important config options that change
 how Aardwolf displays to you. Please type 'next' when you are ready to
 move on to changing how others see your character."

Lao says, "There are a number of optional commands that change how your
 own character is seen by others. I will discuss several of these now."

Lao says, "The 'title' command changes what people see when they 'look' in
 a room. If you were to enter 'title is a fierce warrior!', others would
 see "Laly is a fierce warrior!" when entering your room. More details are
 in 'help title'."

Lao says, "The 'pretitle' command is an option similar to 'title' but is a
 short phrase that displays before your name. If you set your pretitle to
 'Guardian', your full name when interact with others would be 'Guardian
 Laly'."

Lao says, "The title command is always available while pretitles cost
 trivia points to add. Some players find pretitles confusing so there is
 also a 'nopretitle' config option to turn off display of pretitles."

Lao says, "When other players look at you, they see what equipment you are
 using and a description. Your description can be customized using the
 'desc' command. See 'help desc' for how to enter the description editor
 and the commands available."

Lao says, "If you type 'finger [player name]', you may see additional
 information about a player such as an email address, a web site or where
 they're from."

Lao says, "This information is completely optional, but entering an email
 address is recommended. You can use 'email private' to flag your email
 address as only visible to game administration. Your email address is only
 ever used for important game news and password recovery should you lose
 access to your character."

Lao says, "To enter a web site on your character information use the 'www'
 command. To enter your location, use the 'from' command. Setting from
 allows others to find you. For example, typing 'who from florida' shows
 any players online with 'Florida' in their from location."

Lao says, "Sometimes you need to go away from the keyboard for a while.
 The 'afk' command is used to set your character as away. You can also set
 a custom message that anyone sending you a tell while afk will see. The
 'afkmsg' command is used for this."

Lao says, "By default, you do not allow other players to loot your corpse.
 The 'noloot' command turns this off but is generally not recommended. The
 'consent' command allows you to create a small list of players who can
 loot your corpse."

Lao says, "The 'consent' command is useful if you need help with a corpse
 retrieval; temporarily adding someone to your consent list allows them to
 retrieve your equipment for you."

Lao says, "The 'visto' command allows you to create a small list of
 players that can always see you, even if you are invisible or sneaking.
 More on this can be seen in 'help visto'."

Lao says, "The most important configuration options are under 'config all'
 and 'spamreduce'. If there is one thing you do after taking my lesson,
 please study those lists. Some options such as 'noexp' or 'spamreduce
 dodges' can have a huge affect on your gameplay."

Lao says, "Please type 'restart' if you would like to
